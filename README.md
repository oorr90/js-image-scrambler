# JavaScript Image Scrambler
First steps of an image scrambler

This was an assignment in SMCC's Scripting for the Web Fall 2017

I only created the JavaScript file - everything else was written by Prof. Valerie Green, and not meant to be edited

### The Program:
Add the image tiles to the page (in order) to form one large graphic

When the user hovers over an individual tile, the tile will have a border

When the user clicks on an invididual tile, the original image location is replaced with a checkmark
 
The clicked tile image appears in a new div, with the image name displayed

When the user clicks the Hide Original button, the checkmarks are removed
